# FunNote

This program is a  fully functional clone of Microsoft OneNote. This note-taking and organization software features multiple notebooks which can
contain sections that hold individual pages. The pages within these notebook sections can be named by the user and have a date associated with 
their creation. The user can draw figures on the pages using their mouse, and type text within text boxes they can create. The user may also
insert external images into the page by providing a url to the images location. The various notebooks, sections, and pages are saved 
and loaded through various runs of the program.
